        The first in a series exploring the emergent properties of spatial optimization algorithms.
        Investigations focus on the disconnect between the inorganic, sterile systems of code and the resulting animate, biological entities.

    <h3>Algorithm</h3>
    <p>
        One hundred community members are generated, each with a unique location, represented by a three pixel square.
        Each community member is spawned with the desire to be a unique optimal distance from all of its neighbors.
        Each member attempts to achieve its own optimal state by adjusting its position relative to its nearest and farthest neighbors.
        It extends a twenty-point dotted line to both of these neighbors, signifying the special relationships.

        The canvas is cleared only when spawning a new generation, preserving an index of the paths taken.
        This index serves both an aethestic and metaphorical purpose;
        the resulting image resembles a mechanical creature, an emergent system greater than the sum of its parts.
        In the same manner in which a painting emerges from a series of brush strokes,
        the image manifests itself from the relationships of the community members.

        Life of the system is limited to fifty cycles.
